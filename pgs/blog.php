                <p>Through out the years people have been building inventions.but these inventions dint start
                from some already established company. But most of these people started in there backyards,
                garadge in their homes and some got to be established to companies we know. Some examples
                are like apple, facebook and the list is endless some are even being built now.</p>
                <p>So Alike these people who just like building stuff, we also like making these things
                in our backyard workstation. We are a team of many disciplines around electronics who love tinkering with
                stuff like Handymen ,designers ,Programmers ,Engineers ,Artist ,Scientist etc. So we work together
                at backyard workstation to make stuff. Get in touch with us so that we can build for you... 
                apps, websites, iot, install network, even fix your gadgets</p>

                <p>Growing up each kid is creative. They make cars from mad, wires some create dolls add some
                allitle to make it different. But as kids grow older with schools and parenting some
                spark gets turned off coz they dont take risk to try out to build more. And most of these
                kids end up focusing on not to fail thereby taking less risks in their life.!</p>
                <p>
                So Those of us who managed to escape from this life are assembling an army to create
                stuff that we dont know of yet , but as kids do we are not ready to grow yet. Instead
                we wanna build inventions coz we believe that we are still thinking and will create
                from ideas we have daily.!</p>

                <p>We have seen alot of people who are passionate about electronics and other hobbies involving
                building things who never get to make what they want. Most of their complaint
                is where do they get materials to build these things. So remember not all of these things
                you are gonna sell and Most of the things get trashed out once people are done with them.</p>
                <p>So to be resourceful we get those stuff that people throw away to give them new life
                and to use some usable materials from them like wires, motors etc to start from. So as 
                we do we urge you to do likewise, get old stuff take em apart and see what you can create from 
                them. And Finally we are requesting electronics that you dont use anymore..contact us below.</p>
